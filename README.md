# Campus-navigation-system
Data structure course design for freshman year

All codes are written by C language



• Designed this system for the users to query the locations of the campus and for the administrators to add, delete, check and modify the traffic map as well as logging in and modifying the password in the interactive pages

• Designed a user-friendly interactive interface, used Qt to write a GUI graphical interface so as to attach photos to the nodes of each campus building, my application of Dijkstra algorithm made it more efficient and time-consuming to find the shortest path, which would enable users to feel convenient when using the system
